# freezer-app

They say when you're learning to code, create something that solves a personal problem but I can never seem to think of anything. Well, I need to defrost my chest freezer in the basement. I know I'm going to find a bunch of stuff that's in there that I probably forgot about and is too old too be good anymore. I came up with this little app so after I defrost it and start to put stuff back in, I can catalog what goes in and refer to my list rather than donning my ski gloves and digging to the bottom of the freezer to find out what's in there. I know it's nothing more than a glorified to-do app but hey, this is probably the first database connected CRUD app that I've done 100% without tutorials, just me and the code and the docs. Yes, right now there is only one user and it's not password protected so anyone could go in and fill my freezer with a wide variety of funny things, but that will be the next phase.
